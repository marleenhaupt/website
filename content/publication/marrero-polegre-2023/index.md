abstract: 'Introduction: Subjective cognitive complaints in older age may reflect
  subtle objective impairments in basic cognitive functions that might foreshadow
  broader cognitive problems. Such cognitive functions, however, are not captured
  by standard neuropsychological testing. Visual processing speed is a basic visual
  attention function that underlies the performance of cognitive tasks relying on
  visual stimuli. Here, we test the hypothesis that lower visual processing speed
  correlates with greater subjective cognitive complaints in healthy older adults
  from the community. Methods: To do so, we assessed a sample of 30 healthy, cognitively
  normal older adults (73.07 ± 7.73 years old; range: 60–82; 15 females) with respect
  to individual subjective cognitive complaints and visual processing speed. We quantified
  the degree of subjective cognitive complaints with two widely-used questionnaires:
  the Memory Functioning Questionnaire and the Everyday Cognition. We used verbal
  report tasks and the theory of visual attention to estimate a visual processing
  speed parameter independently from motor speed and other visual attention parameters,
  i.e., visual threshold, visual short-term memory storage capacity, top-down control,
  and spatial weighting. Results: We found that lower visual processing speed correlated
  with greater subjective complaints and that this relationship was not explained
  by age, education, or depressive symptoms. The association with subjective cognitive
  complaints was specific to visual processing speed, as it was not observed for other
  visual attention parameters. Discussion: These results indicate that subjective
  cognitive complaints reflect a reduction in visual processing speed in healthy older
  adults. Together, our results suggest that the combined assessment of subjective
  cognitive complaints and visual processing speed has the potential to identify individuals
  at risk for cognitive impairment before the standard tests show any abnormal results.'
