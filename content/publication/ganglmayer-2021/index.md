abstract: Recent theories stress the role of situational information in understanding
  others' behaviour. For example, the predictive coding framework assumes that people
  take contextual information into account when anticipating other's actions. Likewise,
  the teleological stance theory assumes an early developing ability to consider situational
  constraints in action prediction. The current study investigates, over a wide age
  range, whether humans flexibly integrate situational constraints in their action
  anticipations. By means of an eye-tracking experiment, 2-year-olds, 5-year-olds,
  younger and older adults (together N = 181) observed an agent repeatedly taking
  one of two paths to reach a goal. Then, this path became blocked, and for test trials
  only the other path was passable. Results demonstrated that in test trials younger
  and older adults anticipated that the agent would take the continuous path, indicating
  that they took the situational constraints into account. In contrast, 2- and 5-year-olds
  anticipated that the agent would take the blocked path, indicating that they still
  relied on the agent's previous observed behaviour and—contrary to claims by the
  teleological stance theory—did not take the situational constraints into account.
  The results highlight developmental changes in human's ability to include situational
  constraints in their visual anticipations. Overall, the study contributes to theories
  on predictive coding and the development of action understanding.
