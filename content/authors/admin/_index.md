I am a Postdoc in the Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition Lab, led by Dr. Radoslaw M. Cichy. 

I am generally interested in the plasticity of the spatio-temporal dynamics underlying visual processing. Therefore, I am using different types of brain reorganisation, i.e., due to congenital blindness or healthy aging, as a window into exploring the plasticity of these representations.

In my first project, I am addressing how the lack of input to the visual cortex affects object representations. More specifically, I am using multivariate pattern analysis on fMRI data to investigate the neural dynamics underlying word representations during listening and Braille reading in congenitally blind individuals.

In my second project, I am investigating how object representations change over the life span. In cooperation with Douglas Garrett at the Max Planck Institute for Lifespan Development Berlin, I am combining fMRI, EEG and behavioural data in order to determine where and when in the visual processing hierarchy potential age-related changes in object representations occur.
